# Solution 18 - Fine-grained access control for service providers

### SOLUTION DESCRIPTION

##### Problem:

-The business users need to access multiple service providers supporting multiple heterogeneous identity federation protocols.

-Each service provider needs to define an authorization policy at the identity provider, to decide whether a given user is eligible to log into the corresponding service provider.

-For example, one service provider may have a requirement that only the admin users will be able to login into the system after 6 PM.

-Another service provider may have a requirement that only the users from North America should be able to login into the system.

##### Solution:

-Deploy WSO2 Identity Server as the Identity Provider and register all the service providers.

-Build a connector, which connects to the WSO2 Identity Serverâ€™s XACML engine to perform authorization.

-For each service provider, that needs to enforce access control during the login flow, engage the XACML connector to the 2nd authentication step, under the Local and Outbound Authentication configuration.

-Each service provider, that needs to enforce access control during the login flow, creates its own XACML policies in the WSO2 Identity Server PAP (Policy Administration Point).

-To optimize the XACML policy evaluation, follow a convention to define a target element under each XACML policy, that can uniquely identify the corresponding service provider.

Products: WSO2 Identity Server 5.0.0+


### Configurations
1. Follow the steps in this [1] and get a checkout of travelocity sample and build it
svn co http://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/carbon/platform/branches/turing/products/is/5.0.0/modules/samples/sso/
[1]https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS500/Configuring+Single+Sign-On+with+SAML+2.0#ConfiguringSingleSign-OnwithSAML2.0-Prerequisites
2.  Deploy a travelocity web app (travelocity.com.war) in tomcat.
3. Take a copy of travelocity.com.war and rename it as Sol18travelocity.com.war if you are goin gto customise it as Sol18travelocity.com.war. Otherwise you can continue with step 5.
4. Once the Sol18travelocity web app is deployed, replace the travelocity.properties with solution18/src/test/resources/travelocity.properties
5. Edit the travelocity.properties with correct values as given in its comments.

#URIs to skip SSOAgentFilter; comma separated values
#Replace with travelocity app name
SkipURIs=/Sol18travelocity.com/index.jsp


#A unique identifier for this SAML 2.0 Service Provider application
#Replace with Service provider entity ID
SAML2.SPEntityId=Sol18travelocity.com

#The URL of the SAML 2.0 Assertion Consumer
#Replace with tomcat host and port
SAML2.AssertionConsumerURL=http://192.168.57.31:8080/Sol18travelocity.com/home.jsp

#The URL of the SAML 2.0 Identity Provider
#Replace with IS host/port
SAML2.IdPURL=https://is.dev.wso2.org/samlsso

5. Restart the tomcat or web app.
6. Go to solution18/src/test/resources/user.properties file and do the configurations as below.

###### IS Server
host=< HOST NAME OF IS SERVER >

port=< PORT OF THE IS SERVER >

admin_username=< ADMIN USER NAME >

admin_password=< ADMIN PASSWORD >

##### SP
sp1=Sol18travelocity.com

##### Application Details

travelocityApp= < TRAVELOCITY APPLICATION NAME > E.g., Sol18travelocity.com

travelocityIssuer= < ISSUER OF THE TRAVELOCITY APP > E.g., Sol18travelocity.com

##### Tomcat
tomcatHost=< HOSTNAME OF THE TOMECAT >  192.168.57.31

#tomcatHost=<HOSTNAME OF THE TOMCAT >  localhost

tomcatPort= <PORT OF THE TOMCAT> 8080
